For our sprint 4, we divided up work based on what we wanted to impelment and what we thought we could do.
We stayed organized in what we planned on doing and what got done. Some things were jsut a bit more difficult
to implment than we originally palnned for, and so we are behinf schedule on what we wanted to get done. 
However it's not that things have gone poorly for us, we were just a bit unprepared when trying to implment certain
features that were in tandum with each other. We look to continue our progress and plan more accordingly as we near
the end of the project.
