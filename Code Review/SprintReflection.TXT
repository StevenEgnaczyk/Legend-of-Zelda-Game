For our sprint 3 we split roles based on different functions of the project. Our team was ready to complete 
the task, however, we lacked much communication and accountability. We ended up not getting all the 
functionality finished by the deadline. We knew when the deadline was and just asssumed we would be able 
to get it done, but we didn't hold each accountable to ensure it would be done in time. While some 
functionality was not finished in time, we were able to finish up some functions and sprites, which is 
something good for us to build off of and we're definitely happy with those results. For the next sprint 
it would be important for us to establish small collaborative sessions to discuss problems and ideas, to 
check progress and see if someone is behind, and to just keep up strong communication with each other 
for what we want for the sprint.
