For our sprint 5, we divided up work based on what we wanted to impelment and what we thought we could do.
We stayed organized in what we planned on doing and what got done. During the beginning of this sprint it
ended up being a bit of catch up from previous sprints, fixing bugs and making sure the game was running 
smoothly. After we had ironed out our kinks, our teammate John was really our creative inspiration for 
adding the new enemies and for how they looked and acted, from there it was really just figuring out how
to get everything working, and on that front I belive we have done well.
