For our sprint 3 divided up work based on what we thought we could accomplish.
We had a plan on what to do and how we wanted to implement certain aspects of the game.
By the functionality check we didn't have a lot of that functionality, but we were very
close to having a good chunk of it done. We communicated much better this sprint on what
we doing and how long something would take to be finished. We were mainly just confused
on what game aspects we need to have done and implemented by the end of the sprint since 
the sprint page wasn't the most descriptive. However we believe we got most of what this
sprint wanted to accomplish.
