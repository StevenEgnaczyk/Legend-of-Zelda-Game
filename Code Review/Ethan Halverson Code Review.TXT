Comments: In general the code is very exceptional and I like how the room 
          is setup with the populating and drawing. The only compaint I have is 
          with the drawing. The doors and background have their own methods, but
          they could just be put into one, and the doors are a part of the 
          background environment. However, it's not some big problem, and overall
          the code quality is good.
