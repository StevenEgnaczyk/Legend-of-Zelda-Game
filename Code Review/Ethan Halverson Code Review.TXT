Comments: I can see that the code here is very exceptional. The
          doors work as intended when Link passes through them. 
          I don't see what more needs to be done, the doors can 
          unlock when link has a key, and when he doesn't it's locked.
          When link changes rooms, the information of the room is saved
          and link is teleported to the next room. To me it's some
          very quality code.
