Comments: On the aspect of code quality, John's code is well organized, with
		  the use of methods to get tile values such as booleans on whether or
		  not the tile is walkable or pushable.
Change: Not a lot I can say about makng any particular changes. Maybe have method 
		that sets the blocks value using a vector instead of seperate methods of 
		setting the x and y values.
