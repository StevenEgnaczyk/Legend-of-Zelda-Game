Comments: Everything in John's WhiteBrickState.cs class is relatively readable.
		  It is clear what each method's purpose is, there is no unecessary code, 
		  and formatting is all acceptable.
		  The only thing I can say is that comments labeling the sections may be useful,
		  while they may be unecessary in most cases, it will help space out the code.

Comments: On the aspect of code quality, John's code is seemingly well organized, with
		  the use of many methods to split up the different functionalities for the tile's
		  state. I can't see much code that looks different from my implementation of the 
		  state design pattern.
Change: For future sprints it will not be necessary for blocks to switch states during gameplay
		unless of course we decide to implement destructible blocks. So the next and prev methods
		may become unused in most cases. I suggest that there be defined blocks for the level 
		construction, not really needing the state design, because they will not change, and maybe
		repurposing the existing states to draw for a destructible environment aspect.
