Comments: On the aspect of code quality, John's code is well organized, with
		  the use of methods to draw the death screen, wait for dismissal of the screen
		  or figure if the state is transitioning.
Change: Not a lot I can say about makng any particular changes. Maybe the reset upon death
		could be handled here, but I think that the way the code is arranged is good.
