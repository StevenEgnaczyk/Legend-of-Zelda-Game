Comments: The code in Ethan's LinkEnemyCollisionResponse class is very readable. The switch cases are 
		  clear on the functionality that they implement for Link. The comments state what happens in 
		  the actual game.

Comments: The quality of code in the LinkEnemyCollisionResponse class is good. The switch
		  statement and its cases don't have any unused code and does its job.
Change: Pertaining to this specific class, as I'm reviewing this code, it does not have the 
		push back feature when Link collides with the enemy. That's really the only thing I
		can think of when looking at what to change.
