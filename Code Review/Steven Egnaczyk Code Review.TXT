Comments: The code in Ethan's Keese class is very readable. The methods are short and 
		  have clear names for the functions they implement for the enemy. Comments could
		  serve to give more description to what physically happens in game when the 
		  functions are called.

Comments: The qaulity of code in the Keese class is good. The methods are all short and all
		  statements and declarations have purpose and there is no unused code.
Change: Pertaining to this specific class, I'm unsure what changes will need to be made,
		other than removing unnecessary methods for future sprints. For the enemies as a 
		whole, It isn't currently drawing with transparancy, likely an issue with the spritesheet.
