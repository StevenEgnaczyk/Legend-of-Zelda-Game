Comments: The code in Ethan's LinkEnemyCollisionResponse class is very readable. The switch cases are 
		  clear on the functionality that they implement for Link. The comments clearly state what happens
		  in the actual game.

Comments: The qaulity of code in the Keese class is good. The methods are all short and all
		  statements and declarations have purpose and there is no unused code.
Change: Pertaining to this specific class, I'm unsure what changes will need to be made,
		other than removing unnecessary methods for future sprints. For the enemies as a 
		whole, It isn't currently drawing with transparancy, likely an issue with the spritesheet.
