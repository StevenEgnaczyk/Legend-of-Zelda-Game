Comments: The code in Ethan's EnemyManager class is readable. The function of each method
		  is fairly clear. More comments would help when reading methods like removeEnemy,
		  but not the end of the world.

Comments: The quality of code in the EnemyManager class is good. The removeEnemy with random
		  drop rates of items looks good, and the randomStateGenerator also works very well.
Change: On this specific class, I would maybe alter the randomStateGenerator to a switch statement
		instead of a bunch of if else's, but it's not like that's super necessary, so overall 
		very quality code.
