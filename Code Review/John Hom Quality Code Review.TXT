Quality Review: Code quality is good. Everything is working as intended.
                It's similar to how all other enemies are implemented. I
                don't have much to complain about here. I think it's good
                and I can't think of anything else that needs to change,
                it dies, it can change states. There's not much to ask from 
                an enemy class.
