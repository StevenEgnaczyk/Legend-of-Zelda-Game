Quality Review: Code quality is pretty good. The code works as intended. Gets pressed
                keys, checks if it's in controller mappings and then checks if it's 
                in state and executes. Seems pretty good to me. I'm not super sure 
                if you absolutely need to check state if you're alreadt checking 
                controller mappings, but it's important to be cautious I guess.
