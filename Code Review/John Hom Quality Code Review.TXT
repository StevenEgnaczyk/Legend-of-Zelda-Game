Quality Review: Code quality is good. Everything is working as intended.
                It's similar to how all other enemies are implemented. I think it's good
                and I can't think of anything else that needs to change.
                It dies and it can change states. There's not much to ask from 
                an enemy class. Adam has a very unique attack pattern, but that 
                did not complicate any of the code quality for this class.
