Sprint number: 3

Name of the .cs file being reviewed: HeartContainer.cs

Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Dan Flippo

Specific comments on code quality:
Code is overall formatted well for the HeartContainer class and is reusable for the remainder of the project. 
The HeartContainer class uses the IItem Interface. The class has methods for drawing the item and getting its position and dimensions. This is all maintainable for the project as we can add things to update if the heart container needs to have another function and the funcitons it has now will be used again. Overall, the Heart Container class is constructed well and will be maintainable.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
A change that could be made to the game related to the file is to add some type of way to update the heart conatiner after it's picked up. This would easily be included by having the Link item collision check and then have a tyep of method fro when the item gets picked up.
