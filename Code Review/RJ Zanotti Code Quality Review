Sprint number: 5

Name of the .cs file being reviewed: AudioStorage.cs

Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Dan Flippo

Specific comments on code quality:
Code formatted well for the AudioStorage. Each audio file is loaded in and is called in a specific audio file
method for that particular sound that is needed. This allows the method to be called by other classes for their desired sound

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
A change that could be made is to organize the sounds by what they are used for. For example, organize all of Link's sounds into a group, the enemy sounds into a group, and put the
HUD sounds into another group for easier readability and usability.
