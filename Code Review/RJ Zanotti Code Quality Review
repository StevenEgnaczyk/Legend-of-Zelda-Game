Sprint number: 4

Name of the .cs file being reviewed: AudioStorage.cs

Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Dan Flippo

Specific comments on code quality:
Code formatted well for the AudioStorage. Each audio file is loaded in and is called in a specific audio file
method for that particular sound that is needed. Each method will just return the needed audio for that sound.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
There's not much to change in regards of functionality, just made some comments that tell you when this audio is used 
just to kind of keep things oganized, but not much to change here in terms of functionality or function quality.
