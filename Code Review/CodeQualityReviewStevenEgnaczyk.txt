Specific comments on code quality:
Code is really well formatted. It makes use of the design patterns really well to make a seamless transition from the game state to the win-state. 
There are comments for everything and things are intuitive to understand.


A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
One change would be to make the transitioning a little more seamless. This would help when there are more than 5ish scenes to transition between.
