Item inventory can be acceseed with e and exited with escape, and to switch secondary weapon use arrow keys. Press q to quit the game.
Some enemies take more hits than others, and Aquametus must be attacked at the head to die.

We do have some bugs. When you die it doesn't reset the secondary weapon icon, and currently you do not go back to the first room. Sometimes the player will walk into a room and die instantly. Somtimes collisions are buggy.
