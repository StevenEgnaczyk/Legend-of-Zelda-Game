To start the game press spacebar, to mute music press m, to move link sprite press arrow keys, to use link sword and secondary weapon, a and b. HUD can be acceseed with e and exited with escape. In HUD to switch secondary weapon use arrow keys. Press q to quit the game.

We do have some bugs. When you die it doesn't reset the secondary weapon icon. Collisions will sometimes work but also sometimes not with pushable blocks, enemies and projectiles.
