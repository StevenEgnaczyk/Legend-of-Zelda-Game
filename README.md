In order to switch maps, click on the map icon. To move link sprite, arrows or wasd, to use link swords, z and n, to use link items, num keys 1-4. 
We do have some bugs with collisions, sometimes enemies will not die from strikes. When map switching if link is on a non-walkable block he will sometimes walk on the block or be gentlty whisked away to a block which can be walked on.
