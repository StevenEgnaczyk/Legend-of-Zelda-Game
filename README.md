New To sprint 5:
There are extra rooms that are specified in the map file.
These rooms will have one of our new enemies in them, Adam Sandler.
Adam will hit golf balls at you, apologizing if you are hit, but gloating if you are killed.
When Adam is killed he will drop a "DaToken". When 5 DaTokens are collected, the bottom door of the starting room will open.
This new room will have our other new enemy, DaBossBaby, who will also throw golf balls. Killing DaBossBaby is now the only way to Win the game.

 Bugs:
 Sometimes enemies or enemy projectiles can push link out of bounds, if that occurs, walk off screen and it will cause link to die for a reset.
